A Caesar cypher is a weak form of encryption that involves “rotating” each letter by
a fixed number of places. To rotate a letter means to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around
to the beginning if necessary, so ’A’ rotated by 3 is ’D’ and ’Z’ rotated by 1 is ’A’.
To rotate a word, rotate each letter by the same amount. For example, “cheer” rotated by 7 is “jolly”
and “melon” rotated by -10 is “cubed”. In the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, the ship computer
is called HAL, which is IBM rotated by -1.
Write a function called rotate_word that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and returns
a new string that contains the letters from the original string rotated by the given amount.
You might want to use the built-in function ord, which converts a character to a numeric code, and
chr, which converts numeric codes to characters. Letters of the alphabet are encoded in alphabetical
order
